# Discord-Projects

Hello, this is a collection/compilation of all the discord bots that I have worked on in the past.

Secret Santa Bot
-----------------
Small project that utilizes SQLite3 to store the information of all Secret Santa participants. Using a certain command will randomly assign all participants a person to give a gift to. If anyone needs to change their information at any time, they are able to update it and it will notify their gifter. Communication can also happen between the gifter and the giftee through the bot and it will keep the gifter's identity hidden.

Not specified above (Mostly in archived)
--------------------
If I did not mention the project above, this is a project that I have most likely abandoned due to varying factors. A lot of these bots were just modified version of 'KananBot', which was used to help moderate Love Live! Discord servers for a period of time until it eventually got replaced.
